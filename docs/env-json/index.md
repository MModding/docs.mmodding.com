## Concept Overview

env.json is a Minecraft Library introducing a new type of json files, as well as ways to parse it and use it.
It does nothing more than that on its own, as players will use projects implementing, such as
[Environment Driven Assets](https://modrinth.com/mod/env-driven-assets) or
[Environment Driven Data](https://modrinth.com/mod/env-driven-data) (future project).
